# Minesweeper-EOD
https://m-d-hoang.github.io/Minesweeper-EOD/
Uses class-based components because it is based on an older minesweeper clone that i did not complete. In the end, I did not reuse that much code and would have been better doing this from scratch with functions. 

## Gameplay
Cross the minefield as quickly as possible without blowing up the mines. Reveal and flag cells surrounding the player only to find a path.

## Controls
WASD - Caracter movement

Right click - Flag/Unflag

Left click - Reveal
